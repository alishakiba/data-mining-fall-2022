## Source Codes:
* Session 4 [(Basic Classifier)](https://github.com/alishakiba/data-mining-fall-2022/blob/master/Basic%20Classifier.ipynb): Basic Classification Methods (based on the Chapter 3 of [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/))
* Session 7 [(Linear Regression)](https://github.com/alishakiba/data-mining-fall-2022/blob/master/Training%20Models.ipynb): Linear regression, Gradient Descent and variants, polynomial features (based on the Chapter 3 of [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/))

## Exercises:
1. (Due date: 2022-11-09) Run the [Basic Classifier](https://github.com/alishakiba/data-mining-fall-2022/blob/master/Basic%20Classifier.ipynb) notebook for the dataset of your choice, other than MNIST, and try to get used to the `sklearn` library and the way the methods are used. You can find a list of possible datasets at [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data).
